4.	Description
Ada's gameboy is part of the Ada's House game. It is a 2D platformer game. 
The player controls the protagonist to adventure in a maze composed of furniture, collect nine twisted clocks hidden in the house, and finally pass the level after 
hanging all the clocks on the tree at the end. During the game, players will transform into furniture in Ada's House and switch to different forms to travel through 
the maze. Each form can play a role when facing different terrains. For example, when encountering a newspaper obstacle, you can switch to a candle to burn the newspaper to open a passage.
There is a small amount of dialogue in the game, used for tutorials and hints. In most cases, players can fully explore the maze until all the clocks are collected.
The main style of the game is tentatively decided to be pixel style. The main direction of our group's will be working on high-quality, interesting puzzles. 
We hope players can discover the fun of solving puzzles in a short experience.
